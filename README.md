# Static Comp Challenge

### Abstract
This is a Turing project challenge to recreate a static composition, taking some creative liberties while maintaining the structure/integrity of the original design. The purpose is to practice/learning additional skills with HTML and CSS while practicing recreating a given composition. This was created only using HTML and CSS, and is not a fully functional site (and the text is mostly gibberish).

### Context
This was created in Mod 2 of the Turing program, taking about 2 days working on and off between classes and course work.

### Learning Goals
Recreating a static comp from scratch.

### Wins & Challenges
A big challenge was how many elements were in the comp, and how they nested within other elements, so for example a win was getting the individual cards to have photos as backgrounds and overlaying not only arrows and text over them but a color to 'mute' it somewhat. Also in that vein, taking vectors and coloring them in, as well as using grid in CSS to make certain elements. Also a good exercise in using a consistent palette of colors and fonts.
